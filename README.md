# Star-Repetition

**write a program that reads a word and prints stars (*) equal to the length of the word.**

Input: qwerty

Output: ******

Explanation:

Step 1: Get the input
First, we need to get the input from the user, which is a word.
Here, input() is a function that allows the user to enter a word, and word is a variable that stores the entered word.

Step 2: Find the length of the word
Next, we need to find out how many letters are in the word. We can do this using the len() function.
len() is a function that gives us the number of characters in a string. Here, word_length is a variable that will store the length of the word.

Step 3: Create the star pattern
Now that we know the length of the word, let's create a string of stars with the same length. We can do this by multiplying the star character with the length of the word.
Here, result is a variable that will store the star pattern.

Step 4: Print the star pattern
Finally, we'll print the star pattern on the screen using the print() function.
The print() function displays the value of the variable result, which is our star pattern.

Follow the above steps to create a string of stars(*) that is equal to the length of input word.
